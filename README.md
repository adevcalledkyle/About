<h2>Expense Tracker 💲🛒🏦</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Having completed a vue.js tutorial recently by Traversery Media for building an expense Tracker I wanted to continue exploring the functionality of the idea and build it to handle more use cases like living expenses and budgeting in situations like travelling. In the original tutorial, the project created the ability to input, track, calculate, and preserve the income and expenses of the user. This required adapting the original design to introduce new elements to deliver new functionality to a user and have more control over their finances. </p>
